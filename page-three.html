       <p>Now that the eggs and ingredients are ready, we can start boiling the eggs.</p>   
       <p>Add the ingredients to a medium pot filled with water, gently put all the eggs into it, and bring the mixture to a boil. Then reduce the heat to keep the water at barely simmering temperature. This is because boiling water evaporates fast and doesn't increase the speed of flavors seeping into the eggs. </p> 
       <p><b>Tip:</b> You can also braise the ingredients for a longer time, and then add the eggs into the boiling water. This will help extract the flavors from the spices to the full extent.</p>

          <br>
          <h2>Hard boiled vs soft boiled</h2>
          <p><b>The time of simmering depends on how hard you want the eggs to be.</b> Traditional Chinese style  tea eggs are usually heated on a stove and has been boiled for quite a long time. As a result, the egg white becomes quite rubberlike and the yolk becomes quite hard and dry.  The Japanese version is with the egg yolk barely cooked. </p>

          <p>Soft boiled eggs are incredibly delicious due to the egg tolk's smooth texture, but they are not recommended for people with a weak immune system as its raw egg yolk can increase the risk of <b>Salmonella. </b></p>
          
          <p>Live poultry can carry bacteria such as Salmonella, which can contaminate the inside of eggs before the shells are formed. Egg shells may become contaminated with Salmonella from live poultry droppings (poop) or the area where the eggs are laid. But don't worry, CDC(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) provides several methods to reduce the chance of getting a Salmonella infection:</p>
          
          
          <ul>
            <li>Keep eggs refrigerated at 40°F (4°C) or colder at all times. Only buy eggs from stores and suppliers that keep them refrigerated.</li>
            <li>Discard cracked or dirty eggs.</li>
            <li>Consider buying and using pasteurized eggs and egg products, which are widely available.</li>
            <li>Cook eggs until both the yolk and white are firm. Egg dishes should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C) or hotter.</li>
            <li>Make sure that foods that contain raw or lightly cooked eggs, such as hollandaise sauce, Caesar salad dressing, and tiramisu, are made only with pasteurized eggs.</li>
            <li>Eat or refrigerate eggs and foods containing eggs promptly after cooking. Do not keep eggs or foods made with eggs warm or at room temperature for more than 2 hours, or 1 hour if the temperature is 90°F or hotter.</li>
            <li>Wash hands and items that came into contact with raw eggs—including countertops, utensils, dishes, and cutting boards—with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Do not taste or eat any raw dough or batter, such as cookie dough and cake mix, made with raw eggs. Bake or cook raw dough and batter before eating.</li>
          </ul>
          
        <p>Basically, if you prefer the texture of soft boiled eggs, you'd better use pasteurized eggs to reduce the risk. </p>
          
          <p>So how long exactly should the eggs be simmered to get a soft yolk? Though it is often related to specific conditions such as the fire temperature and the material of the pot, we have a general rule that you can refer to:</p>
          
          <ul>
              <li><i>SOFT BOILED:</i> Simmer the eggs for 2-3 minutes for runny yolks;</li>
              <li><i>MEDIUM SOFT BOILED: </i>Simmer the eggs for 3-5 minutes;</li>
              <li><i>MEDIUM BOILED:</i> Simmer the eggs for 5-7 minutes for semi-firm yolks and hard whites;</li>
              <li><i>HARD BOILED:</i> Simmer the eggs for 8-9 minutes for well cooked, hard boiled eggs.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <br>
          <p>Go ahead and leave the marinating liquid simmer for the time you prefer. When time is up, turn off the heat and open the lid. Hang on, we are almost there.</p>

      <h2>Picking out fresh eggs</h2>
          
       <p>Using fresh eggs is a prerequisite for making tea eggs. There are three common ways to test freshness:</p>   
       <p style='line-height: 0.5rem;'>1. Float test</p> 
          <p>Place an egg in a bowl of water,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>if it sinks and lies horizontally at the bottom, it's fresh;</li>
            <li>if it sinks but stands upright at the bottom, it's not fresh enough but still okay to eat;</li>
            <li>if it floats, it's gone bad.</li>
          </ul>
          
        <p>Eggshells are very porous, so as time goes by, the egg loses moisture, causing its contents to shrink. At the same time, a small air pocket inside the shell starts to expand, causing the egg to float in water.</p>
          
       <br>
        <p style='line-height: 0.5rem;'>2. Smell</p>
        <p>Fresh eggs have a neutral scent and should not smell sulfuric or sour.</p>  
          
       <br>
        <p style='line-height: 0.5rem;'>3. Shake</p>
        <p>Hold the egg next to your ear and shake it. If you hear the inside of the egg sloshing around, it means the egg is rotten. If you can’t hear or feel the contents of the egg move, it means it’s fresh and you can eat it.</p>
          
          <br>
          <h2>Key ingredients</h2>
          <p>Eggs are braised with the flavoring liquid comprising of tea, soy sauce, and spices. The barebone ingredients are tea, soy sauce, sugar, cinnamon, and star anise. You can also include other components for a more wholesome flavor, such as ginger, Sichuan peppercorns, and dried chili.</p>
          
          <p><b>Tea leaves:</b> Tea leaves are the most important ingredient in this recipe. You can add a tea bag to the flavoring liquid. Black tea is commonly used in this recipe, but other types of teas are suitable too.</p>
          <p><b>The spices:</b> The two most essential spices in this recipe are cinnamon and star anise. For simplicity, you can use a teaspoon of Chinese five-spice powder to substitute most of the spices in the recipe. </p>

          </div>
          
          <p><b>Soy sauce:</b> This recipe requires Chinese light soy sauce. You can add a small amount of dark soy sauce to make the eggs darker after soaking in the liquid. If you want to make the Japanese style soy sauce egg, choose the Japanese soy sauce. The flavor is slightly different.</p>
          <p><b>Sugar:</b> White or brown sugar are both fine. </p>
          
          <p><b>Salt:</b> The amount of salt required depends on the final amount of the flavoring liquid, which in turn depends on the size of the container to store the eggs. It also depends on the saltiness of the soy sauce that you choose. </p>

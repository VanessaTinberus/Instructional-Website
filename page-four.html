          <p>After some time of simmering, you can transfer the eggs into ice water until it is cold. Placing the eggs in ice water <b>serves two purposesï¼š</b></p>   
    
          <ul>
            <li>First, it stops cooking immediately by lower the temperature quickly. As a result, it avoids further oxidation of the surface of the yolk, and preserve the bright color.</li>
            <li>Secondly, rapid cooling results in contraction of the egg, causing it to detach from the shell, so it can be easier to peel.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <br>
        <p>Now you get a pot of marinating water and some eggs either with shells cracked or intact. The final step is to make the flavors seep into the eggs. There are two ways to achieve this goal:</p>
          
          <p>1. Simmer the eggs</p>
          <p>This is the preferred method if you want to make the marble-like eggs. The heat during simmering will force the flavoring liquid to seep through the cracks.</p>
          <p>Put the eggs with the cracked shells into the marinating liquid and let it simmer for ten minutes. The boiling liquid expedites the infusion of the flavor into the eggs. The advantage of this method is speed but may tend to overcook the eggs and become rubbery. The heat will speed up the oxidation process, which can turn the bright yellow color of the egg yolk surface into grey. </p>
          
          <p>2. Steep the eggs</p>
          <p>This is the preferred method if you remove the shells of the eggs. The eggs will pick up the color of the liquid evenly, resulting in an even brown color. Since the eggs are not heated up once more, the oxidation of the surface of the yolk is slowing down, resulting in a much pleasant looking egg yolk. </p>
          <p>Put the boiled egg into the flavoring liquid. Let the eggs steep in the liquid overnight or for more than one day to absorb the savory flavor from the liquid. </p>
          
          <br>
          <p>Now after hours of waiting, your tea eggs are ready to eat! If you can't eat them up at once, store them in the refrigerator.</p>
